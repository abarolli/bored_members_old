This is a website where people can get into random chat rooms and discuss business ideas.

The landing page gives the user a broad overview of the sites functions.
Clicking on the View Rooms option under the Rooms tab in the navigation bar
will send the user to a table displaying all the publicly accessible rooms.

The sign up and sign in buttons redirect the user to sign up/sign in pages. These use some basic html/js validation.

The animations were mostly done with the help of a JS library called AOS (Animation on Scroll). I also incorporated some of
my own animations.
